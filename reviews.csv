With Asda you can book a slot and then only add a couple of items and then go to checkout knowing you have till 10pm the day before delivery to amend the order and reach £40 or more... With yourselves you have to add £40 or more straight away or it won't let you book delivery. It's so much better doing this the day before delivery as If I book a slot for a week away I've no idea what I want at 1st...,2,17,v0.179 morrisonsRelease,2020-11-25 22:15:52,,,v0.179 morrisonsRelease,newest,com.morrisons.atm.mobile.android

Edit: dropping from 2 to 1 star due to instability. Edit: retiring payplus and then wallet and moving the functionality into this was a good idea but the execution has been awful.

This means things you really need (like toilet paper!) just don't get delivered and there's no notification of this (unlike if they're out of stock on the day when replacements are offered). This is totally unacceptable and has meant I've had to go out and buy them separately defeating the point of home delivery!,3,35,19.21.1,2021-09-17 10:02:41,,,19.21.1,most_relevant,com.tesco.grocery.view
